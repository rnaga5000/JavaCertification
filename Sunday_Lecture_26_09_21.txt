Array is a collection of elements/values having same data type.it is also knwon as collection
homogenous elements/values.we use array so that multiple values of same datatype we can 
store in one variable.first value of an array is stored in 0th index.

int arr[]={1,2,3,4,5};
arr[0]=1
arr[1]=2
arr[2]=3
arr[3]=4
arr[4]=5

Assignment on Arrays
Q1.WAP where there will be 2 arrays and find out unmatched values
ex:- arr1[]={1,2,3}
     arr2[]={3,4,5}

Ans 1 and 2 values from arr1 are not matched

Q2. WAP to read the name from user and print it in following format
Ex:- Keshav
K
Ke
Kes
Kesh
Kesha
Keshav

Q3. WAP to print the minimum value from array
Ex:- int arr1[]={1,3,2}

Output :-
minimum value is 1

OOP helps us to understrand programming concepts by comparing them with real-world
examples, it is also called as "Real-World Modelling".initially it was introduced by
bjarne stroustrup in C++.


			CAR						LMS
Properties		model,engine,color,wheels		Rid,Rname,Rmobile
								Aid,Aname,Amobile
								Bid,Bname,Btype,bpage

Behavior/method		start(),stop(),acc(),break()		getReadersInfo(),printReadersInfo()
			reverse(),beep();			getAuthorInfo(),printAuthorInfo()
								getBookInfo(),printBookInfo()
								fine()
Features of OOP
1.Object	:-object is any real thing in the world which we can see,touch,feel or being presentable
		to the senses.object have its own properties and method by which we can identify that
		object.object is unique,object have its own limitations which that object cannot crossed.
		object is an instance of a class,object is a run-time entity
 
2.Class		:- it is a collection of objects having similar properties and methods.In Java,
		class can contain, member variables(variable),member function(method),constructor.

3.Abstraction	:- it is a process where we focus on required properties of an object.
		Ex:- color of car is red

4.Encapsulation :- it is a process where we hide the irrelivant things from end user, it is 
		also called as Data Hiding.

5.Inheritance  :- it is a process where we inherit/abstract/carry forward properties / variables
		and methods / function from super/base/parrent to sub/deried/child class
		
		inheritance is the process where we inherit vasriables and methods from 
		one class to another class

		in Java,we have 2 types of inheritance
		1.Single 
		2.multilevel

		

6.Polymorphism	:- it is process where object behave differently under different circumstances.
		"Poly" mean "many" and "morph" means "forms", which means when we have many
		forms of single object then its called as polymorphism.
